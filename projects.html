        <h1>My Github</h1>
    </a>
    <p>Much of my github consists of school projects. A lot of them invisible to keep my work from tempting someone to
        plagiarism
    </p>
    <p>My favorites are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href='https://twitter.com/Got_InTheBack'>A twitter bot</a> that tweets variations on the phrase "I got
            the horses in the back"</li>
        <li><a href='https://github.com/jenniferamartin21/Discord'>A discord bot</a> that talks like a dad.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the future I want it to be filled with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tools for others in my line of work</li>
        <li>Code for writeups and tutorials</li>
        <li>Contributions to open source projects I love</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>In the fall and summer of 2019 I worked with Mr. <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/fidai/'>Aamir Fidai</a> and
        AggieSTEM on two research projects.</p>
    <p>The first was a LAUNCH Undergraduate Research poster on visual programming languages in education. You can find
        the abstract <a
            href='https://launch.tamu.edu/LAUNCH/media/library/UGR/REU-SURE/docs/(official)-S19_REU-SURE_Summer-Poster-Session_Abstract-Book.pdf'>here.</a>
        on page 15.</p>
    <p>The second took place throughout the fall semester. My team taught <a href='scratch.mit.edu'>scratch</a> to 4th
        graders in the STEM club at a local elementary school, while the other team guided the students in building a 3D
        printed robot. Their research continues, though I am no longer a part of the project.</p>
