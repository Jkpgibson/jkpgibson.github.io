            <h1>In Principio</h1>
            <p class="date">Posted on February 27, 2020.</p>
            <p>Since this past summer of 2019, when I first bought this domain, I've had nagging ideas about what to do.
                The motivation to do that trope-like task of "working on my website" was a novel one. But what wasn't at all novel
                was the great difficulty of sitting down and doing it. Motivation comes and goes, and has to be flagged down 
                like a taxi sometimes. If you're not ready, the inspiration will strike with nowhere to go.
            </p>
            <p>This past month I finished the first "real" iteration of this website. Previously it had only been a landing page
                with my name on it and links to my GitHub and LinkedIn. I'm still not satisfied, but it suffices for what it should be
                for now: my digital footprint.
            </p>
            <p>I'm not good at writing a blog post at all. I have ideas, but they're only good as long as they stay in my head. 
                My experience with social media has been mostly tossing thoughts into the void, hoping something will stick. Twitter,
                Tumblr, and the like were good for this, but not much else. The writing bug still bites me often,and has done so often
                enough that I've finally decided to do what it wants.
            </p>
            <p>Many will never read what I write. But the same can be said of any great author, no matter how many books they published.
                The joy of writing, I think, comes from <i>ipsissima res</i>. Writing by itself is just fun.
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, I've had many ideas that the bug has injected me with, some related to tasks or projects that
                I've thought were interesting, but have set aside for one reason or another. And I think that writing,
                dangling in front of me like a carrot, will finally be the thing to get me to do them. Instead of hailing
                a taxi, I've decided to call one, and my driver is a bug.
            </p>
