    <h1>My Experience</h1>
    <p>I learned most of what I know in class, and I filled in the gaps with google-fu and elbow grease.</p>
    <p>I've branched out of software into other areas while at Texas A&M.
        I'm fortunate that I was able to take an immersion course at the Mays School of Business last summer. This past
        fall I had the unique experience of teaching programming to 4th graders. Now I'm employed as a security analyst,
        and honing my skills there as a security professional.</p>
    <p>Currently I'm focusing my efforts on Learning network administration. Particularly network security, kerberos,
        and
        active directory. My main goal is to make a respectable homelab. Right now I only have an ancient laptop that I'd
        like to
        refurbish and
        turn into a server for plex and other things. I plan to test for my Security+ certification before I graduate.
        <a href='https://danielmiessler.com/blog/build-successful-infosec-career/'>Daniel Miessler</a> wrote an article
        on his website that I like to read often, both as a reference and as inspiration.</p>
    <p>This May I will begin an internship with the Space Force. I look forward to learning much.</p>

    Here is my resume, for viewing and download.
