    <h1>My Experience</h1>
    <p>I learned most of what I know in class, and I filled in the gaps with google-fu and elbow grease.</p>
    <p>I've branched out of software into other areas while at Texas A&M.
        I'm fortunate that I was able to take an immersion course at the Mays School of Business last summer. This past
        fall I had the unique experience of teaching programming to 4th graders. Now I'm employed as a security analyst
        with the Texas A&M University System, honing my skills there as a security professional.</p>
    <p>Currently I'm focusing my efforts on learning network security, kerberos,
        and
        active directory. My main goal is to make a respectable homelab. Right now I only have an ancient laptop that
        I'd like to refurbish and turn into a server for plex and other things. I plan to test for my Security+
        certification before I graduate.
        <a href='https://danielmiessler.com/blog/build-successful-infosec-career/'>Daniel Miessler</a> wrote an article
        on his website that I like to read often, both as a reference and as inspiration.</p>
    <p>This May I will begin an internship with the US Space Force at Peterson AFB. I look forward to learning much.</p>
    <p>I'm very fortunate to have senior coworkers who are happy to raise me up to greater
        heights than I could reach on my own. After graduating I hope to continue my learning path through the security
        industry, setting my sights on becoming CISSP certified. Security is an incredibly broad field and I'm open to
        any opportuntiy to work in it, without pigeonholing myself into one discipline.
