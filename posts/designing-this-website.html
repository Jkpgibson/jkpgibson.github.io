This summer of 2019, I was living in College Station, Texas, looking for a job and taking classes. The light workload and unemployment meant I had loads of freetime I hadn't anticipated
nor knew what to do with. They say time management is hard; that holds true whether your schedule is booked solid or a near-void. 
Among the activities I found to occupy that empty space was my own personal website. In it I could store the parts of myself and my experiences that wouldn't fit on a resume.
I could also use it to form my own "digital footprint" as I had read, apparently essential to finding a career in the tech industry.

I'm more of a backend guy, having learned Python and C++ in the classroom. So this was a new experience for me. I felt it required a lot more creative power, which
I shamelessly lacked. At the frontend, it's harder to use internet tutorials and stackoverflow as crutches -- which I did frequently in my assignments and in coding challenges.
In the beginning I sought inspiration from others like me, who needed some kind of personalized online resume, to get an idea of what I wanted my website to look like.
I settled on two (whose owners have yet to give me permission to link their websites) to pick out what I liked and needed. From a classmate I learned about github Pages,
which is what this site is hosted on. I bought my own domain, which I guess adds to the cool factor of having your own domain name.

I wanted to build my site from scratch. After all, one of the end goals of this endeavour was to have marketable web design skills that could be backed up by an actual website.
I learned how to build a site with HTML and make it look pretty with CSS. The most important resources I used were lynda.com, which I could use for free as a student, and 
w3schools.com.
