    <h1>Selfless Service</h1>
    <p>Throughout my primary and secondary education, I've had quotas to fill with service hours.</p>
    <h4>Middle School</h4>
    <p>In the summers between grades I volunteered at my Parish's Vacation Bible School for elementary aged children. I
        was a sort of intermediary between the smaller children and the adults who actually ran the show.</p>
    <p>This period was also when I was most active in the <a href='https://www.scouting.org/'>Boy Scouts</a>, performing
        service at odd regular intervals
        whenever the opportunity arose in my troop.</p>
    <h4>High School</h4>
    <p>Here I volunteered with <a href='https://www.samm.org/'>SAMMinistries</a>, an organization founded to combat
        homelessness in San Antonio. I also worked with <a href='https://www.upward-transitions.org/'>Upward
            Transitions</a>, a group which enables individuals with therapeutic horsemanship. This was probably my
        favorite.</p>

    <h4>Today</h4>
    <p>Now I am involved in the <a href='https://www.kofc.org/un/en/college/index.html'>Knights of Columbus</a>, A
        worldwide Catholic fraternal service organization. Much like
        in the Boy Scouts, I serve wherever and whenever I'm needed.</p>
